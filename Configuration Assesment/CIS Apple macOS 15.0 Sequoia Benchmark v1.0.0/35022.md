## Manual Playbook: Enable Location Services Icon in Menu Bar for System Services
#### Objective
Ensure macOS displays the location services icon in the menu bar when system services access location data by enabling the ShowSystemServices setting in com.apple.locationmenu.plist.

## Remediation Methods
### 1. Graphical Method (GUI)
#### Steps:

1. Open System Settings

2. Navigate to Privacy & Security > Location Services

3. Click Details... (next to "System Services")

4. Enable "Show location icon in menu bar when System Services request your location"

5. Close System Settings

#### Verification:

- Verify the setting is enabled by returning to the same menu

- Check for the location icon (arrow) in the menu bar when system services access location

### 2. Terminal Method (Command Line)
Command:

```bash
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.locationmenu.plist ShowSystemServices -bool true
```
#### Verification:
Run the following command to check if the setting is enabled:

```bash
defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.locationmenu.plist ShowSystemServices
```
Expected Output:

```text
1
```
or

```text

```
### Notes
If the check fails, reapply the alternative method and verify again.
