## Manual Playbook: Configure Login Window to Show Name and Password
### Objective
Ensure macOS login window requires both username and password entry, rather than showing user icons, to improve authentication security.

## Remediation Methods
### 1. Graphical Method (GUI)
#### Steps:

1. Open System Settings

2. Navigate to Lock Screen (or Users & Groups > Login Options on older macOS versions)

3. Set "Login window shows" to "Name and Password"

4. Close System Settings

#### Verification:

Log out and verify the login screen now shows username/password fields instead of user icons

**Note:** Changes may require logout/login to take effect

### 2. Terminal Method (Command Line)
Command:

```bash
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWFULLNAME -bool true
```
#### Verification:
Run the following command to check the setting:

```bash
osascript -l JavaScript -e "$.NSUserDefaults.alloc.initWithSuiteName('com.apple.loginwindow').objectForKey('SHOWFULLNAME')"
```
Expected Output (Pass Condition):

```text
1
```
or

```text
true
```
