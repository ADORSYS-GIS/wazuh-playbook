### Step-by-Step Playbook: Secure GRUB Configuration File Permissions

#### **Objective**  
Ensure the GRUB configuration file (`/boot/grub/grub.cfg`) is owned and accessible only by the root user to prevent unauthorized viewing or modification of boot parameters.

---

### **Step 1: Pre-Assessment Verification**
Verify current ownership and permissions of the GRUB configuration file.

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check ownership
ls -l /boot/grub/grub.cfg

# Check permissions (numeric format)
stat -c "%a %n" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

**Expected Output:**  
If compliant, ownership should be `root:root`, and permissions should be `600` (rw-------) or stricter (e.g., `400`). Non-compliant examples include group/others having read access (e.g., `644`).

---

### **Step 2: Remediation Actions**
#### **2.1 Set Ownership to root:root**
```bash
sudo chown root:root /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

#### **2.2 Restrict Permissions**
```bash
sudo chmod u-wx,go-rwx /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
- `u-wx`: Removes write/execute for the owner (root retains **read-only** unless explicitly set).
- `go-rwx`: Removes all permissions for group/others.

**Note:**  
This command sets permissions to `400` (r--------), making the file read-only for root. If write access for root is required (e.g., for GRUB updates), use `600` instead:  
```bash
sudo chmod 600 /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

---

### **Step 3: Post-Remediation Verification**
Confirm changes took effect.

**Commands:**
```bash
ls -l /boot/grub/grub.cfg
stat -c "%a %n" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-r-------- 1 root root ... /boot/grub/grub.cfg  # Permissions 400
```
or (if using `600`):
```
-rw------- 1 root root ... /boot/grub/grub.cfg  # Permissions 600
```

---

### **Summary**
By restricting ownership and permissions of `grub.cfg`, you mitigate risks of non-root users exploiting boot-level vulnerabilities. Regularly audit permissions after system updates to ensure compliance.
