**Step-by-Step Playbook for rsync Configuration Assessment and Remediation**

**1. Assessment Phase**

**Objective:** Determine if rsync is installed, active, or enabled on the system.

1. **Check if rsync is installed:**
   ```bash
   dpkg -s rsync 2>/dev/null | grep Status
   ```
   - **Expected Result:** 
     - If installed: `Status: install ok installed`
     - If not installed: No output or `dpkg-query: package 'rsync' is not installed`.

2. **Check if the rsync service is running:**
   ```bash
   systemctl is-active rsync 2>/dev/null
   ```
   - **Expected Result:** 
     - `active` (running) or `inactive` (not running).

3. **Check if the rsync service is enabled to start on boot:**
   ```bash
   systemctl is-enabled rsync 2>/dev/null
   ```
   - **Expected Result:** 
     - `enabled`, `disabled`, or `masked`.

4. **Verify rsync processes:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep '[r]sync'
   ```
   - **Expected Result:** 
     - No output indicates no active rsync processes.
     - Output suggests rsync is running.

5. **Check if rsync port (TCP 873) is listening:**
   ```bash
   ss -tuln | grep ':873' || netstat -tuln | grep ':873'
   ```
   - **Expected Result:** 
     - No output indicates the port is not in use.
     - Output confirms rsync is listening.

**2. Remediation Phase**

**Option 1: Remove rsync (Recommended for Unnecessary Installations)**

1. **Uninstall the rsync package:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt purge rsync -y
   ```
   - **Note:** This permanently removes rsync and its configuration files.

2. **Verify removal:**
   ```bash
   dpkg -s rsync 2>/dev/null || echo "rsync is not installed"
   ```

**Option 2: Stop and Mask rsync Service (If rsync is Required but Should Not Run)**

1. **Stop the rsync service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop rsync
   ```

2. **Mask the rsync service to prevent activation:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl mask rsync
   ```
   - **Note:** Masking links the service to `/dev/null`, making it impossible to start.

3. **Verify service status:**
   ```bash
   systemctl status rsync
   ```
   - **Expected Result:** 
     - `Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit rsync.service is masked.)`
     - `Active: inactive (dead)`

**3. Post-Remediation Validation**

1. **Confirm rsync is not running:**
   ```bash
   systemctl is-active rsync && echo "Service is active!" || echo "Service is inactive."
   ```

2. **Ensure rsync port is not listening:**
   ```bash
   ss -tuln | grep ':873' || echo "Port 873 is not in use."
   ```

3. **Check for remaining rsync processes:**
   ```bash
   pgrep rsync && echo "Processes found!" || echo "No processes found."
   ```

**4. Considerations & Documentation**

- **Dependencies:** 
  - Before removing rsync, check if critical packages depend on it:
    ```bash
    apt-cache rdepends rsync
    ```
- **Alternatives:** 
  - If file synchronization is required, use encrypted alternatives (e.g., `rsync over SSH`, `scp`, or `sftp`).
- **Documentation:** 
  - Record actions taken in the system change log.
  - Update internal security compliance documentation.
- **Communication:** 
  - Notify stakeholders if rsync was integral to workflows.

**5. Rollback Steps (If Needed)**

1. **Reinstall rsync:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install rsync -y
   ```

2. **Unmask and restart the service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl unmask rsync
   sudo systemctl start rsync
   ```

**Summary**  
This playbook ensures rsync is either securely removed or disabled, reducing the systemâ€™s attack surface. Prioritize removal (Option 1) unless rsync is explicitly required in a non-service capacity. Always validate changes and document outcomes.
