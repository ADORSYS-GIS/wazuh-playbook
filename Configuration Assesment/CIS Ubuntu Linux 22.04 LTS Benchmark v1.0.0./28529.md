### Step-by-Step Playbook: Securing Single User Mode Authentication

#### **Objective**:  
Ensure single user mode requires authentication by setting a password for the root user.

### **Assessment Steps**

1. **Check Root Password Status**  
   - **Command**:  
     ```bash
     sudo passwd -S root
     ```  
   - **Expected Output**:  
     `root P [date] 0 99999 7 -1` (Where `P` indicates a password is set).  
   - **Alternative Method**:  
     ```bash
     sudo grep '^root:' /etc/shadow
     ```  
     - If the second field (password hash) is empty, `!`, or `*`, the root account has no password or is locked.

2. **Identify Vulnerability**  
   - **Finding**:  
     If the root password is **not set** (output shows `L` for locked or no hash in `/etc/shadow`), the system is non-compliant.

### **Remediation Steps**

1. **Set Root Password**  
   - **Command**:  
     ```bash
     sudo passwd root
     ```  
   - **Follow Prompts**:  
     Enter and confirm a strong password for the root user.  

2. **Verify Remediation**  
   - Re-run the assessment commands to confirm:  
     ```bash
     sudo passwd -S root  # Should show "P" (password set)
     sudo grep '^root:' /etc/shadow  # Password field should now contain a hash.
     ```

### **Summary**  
By ensuring the root account has a password, single user mode will prompt for credentials before granting access, mitigating unauthorized privilege escalation.
