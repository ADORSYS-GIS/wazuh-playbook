### Step-by-Step Playbook: Configure Login Banner in `/etc/issue.net`

#### **Objective**  
Ensure the `/etc/issue.net` login banner displays a legal warning without exposing OS/patch details (e.g., `\m`, `\r`, `\s`, `\v`).

---

### **Step 1: Backup the Current `/etc/issue.net` File**
Before making changes, create a backup to restore from if needed.

```bash
sudo cp /etc/issue.net /etc/issue.net.backup
```

---

### **Step 2: Review Existing Content**
Check for prohibited escape codes (`\m`, `\r`, `\s`, `\v`) and OS information.

```bash
sudo grep -E '\\m|\\r|\\s|\\v' /etc/issue.net
```

- **Expected Result**:  
  If no output, the file is compliant. If escape codes are found, proceed to remediation.

---

### **Step 3: Create a Compliant Login Banner**
Draft a legal warning that includes:  
- Organization name.  
- Monitoring policies.  
- No OS/patch details or escape codes.

**Example**:  
```plaintext
Authorized uses only. All activity is monitored and reported by [Organization Name].
```

---

### **Step 4: Update `/etc/issue.net`**
Replace the file contents with the compliant banner.

```bash
# Use sudo to overwrite the file
sudo sh -c 'echo "Authorized uses only. All activity may be monitored and reported" > /etc/issue.net'
```

---

### **Step 5: Validate the Changes**
1. Confirm no escape codes or OS details remain:  
   ```bash
   sudo cat /etc/issue
   ```
   - Ensure no `\m`, `\r`, `\s`, `\v` are present.

2. Verify file permissions:  
   ```bash
   sudo ls -l /etc/issue.net
   ```
   - **Correct Permissions**: `-rw-r--r-- 1 root root`

---

### **Step 6: Test the Login Banner**
1. Open a new local terminal (e.g., via Ctrl+Alt+F1-F6 on Linux).  
2. Observe the pre-login banner.  
3. Ensure it matches the updated message and lacks OS details.

---

### **Step 7: Ensure Persistence Across Reboots**
The `/etc/issue.net` file is static and persists by default. No additional action is needed unless automated tools overwrite it (e.g., cloud-init).  
- If your system uses automated provisioning, update the configuration toolâ€™s template.

---

### **Final Validation**
1. **Command**:  
   ```bash
   sudo cat /etc/issue.net
   ```
---

### **Documentation**
- Update system documentation to reflect the new login banner policy.  
- Notify users of monitoring policies if required by organizational rules.

---

**Why This Works**:  
- Removes sensitive OS details attackers could exploit.  
- Complies with legal requirements for user notifications.  
- Uses Unix best practices for secure configuration.
