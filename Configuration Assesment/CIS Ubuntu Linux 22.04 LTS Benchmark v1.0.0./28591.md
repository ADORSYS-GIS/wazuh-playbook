### Playbook: Enable and Start auditd Service for System Event Logging

#### **Objective**  
Ensure the `auditd` daemon is **active** (running) and **enabled** (starts automatically on boot) to capture system events for security monitoring.

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

#### **1. Pre-Checks: Verify Current Status of auditd**
**Purpose**: Confirm if `auditd` is already configured correctly.

- **1.1 Check if auditd is Active**  
  Run:  
  ```bash
  systemctl is-active auditd
  ```  
  **Expected Output**:  
  ```bash
  active
  ```  
  - If the output is **"active"**, proceed to Step 1.2.  
  - If the output is **"inactive"**, proceed to Remediation (Step 2).

- **1.2 Check if auditd is Enabled**  
  Run:  
  ```bash
  systemctl is-enabled auditd
  ```  
  **Expected Output**:  
  ```bash
  enabled
  ```  
  - If the output is **"enabled"**, no further action is needed.  
  - If the output is **"disabled"**, proceed to Remediation (Step 2).

---

#### **2. Remediation: Enable and Start auditd**
**Purpose**: Activate `auditd` immediately and ensure it starts on boot.

- **2.1 Run the Remediation Command**  
  Execute:  
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl --now enable auditd
  ```  
  **Explanation**:  
  - `enable`: Configures `auditd` to start automatically on boot.  
  - `--now`: Starts the service immediately.

---

#### **3. Post-Remediation Verification**
**Purpose**: Confirm the remediation was successful.

- **3.1 Recheck Service Status**  
  Repeat Steps 1.1 and 1.2.  
  Both commands must return **"active"** and **"enabled"**.

---

### **Troubleshooting**

#### **Issue 1: "Failed to enable unit: Unit file auditd.service does not exist"**  
**Cause**: The `auditd` package is not installed.  
**Resolution**:  
Please consult playbook `28590` to install the auditd package.

---

### **Notes**  
- **Permissions**: Use `sudo` if you lack root privileges.  
- **Persistence**: The `--now` flag ensures the service starts immediately and persists across reboots.  
- **Security Compliance**: Required for frameworks like PCI DSS, CIS Benchmarks, and STIG.  

---

### **Summary**  
By enabling and starting `auditd`, you ensure continuous monitoring of system events for security auditing. Always validate the service status after remediation.
