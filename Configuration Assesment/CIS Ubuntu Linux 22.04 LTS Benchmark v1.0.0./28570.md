### Step-by-Step Playbook: Uninstall Telnet and Secure Communication with SSH

#### **Objective**:  
Remove the insecure telnet client, ensure no telnet services are running, and promote the use of SSH for encrypted communication.

---

### **Step 1: Verify Telnet Installation**
**Action**:  
Check if the `telnet` client or server packages are installed.  
**Command**:  
```bash
dpkg -l | grep -E 'telnet|telnetd'
```
**Expected Output**:  
- If installed, packages like `telnet` (client) or `telnetd` (server) will appear.  
- If no results, telnet is not installed.

---

### **Step 2: Identify Telnet-Dependent Services**  
**Action**:  
Check if telnet services (e.g., `telnet.socket`) are active.  
**Commands**:  
```bash
systemctl list-unit-files | grep telnet
```
**Considerations**:  
- If services like `telnet.socket` are enabled, they must be stopped and disabled.

---

### **Step 3: Stop and Disable Telnet Services**  
**Action**:  
Terminate active telnet services and prevent them from starting on boot.  
**Commands**:  
```bash
sudo systemctl stop telnet.socket    # Stop the service
sudo systemctl disable telnet.socket # Disable auto-start
```
**Note**:  
- Replace `telnet.socket` with the actual service name if different.

---

### **Step 4: Uninstall Telnet Packages**  
**Action**:  
Remove the telnet client and server packages.  
**Commands**:  
```bash
# Remove the telnet client
sudo apt purge telnet -y

# Remove telnet server (if present)
sudo apt purge telnetd -y
```
**Explanation**:  
- `purge` removes both the package and its configuration files.

---

### **Step 5: Verify Successful Removal**  
**Action**:  
Confirm telnet packages are fully removed.  
**Command**:  
```bash
dpkg -l | grep -E 'telnet|telnetd'
```
**Expected Outcome**:  
- No telnet-related packages should appear.

---

### **Optional Step: Install/Enable SSH (Optional Secure Alternative)**  
**Action**:  
Ensure SSH is installed and running for secure remote access.  
**Commands**:  
```bash
# Install SSH client and server (if not installed)
sudo apt install openssh-client openssh-server -y

# Enable and start the SSH service
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```
**Verification**:  
```bash
systemctl status ssh  # Should show "active (running)"
```
---

**Remediation**:  
- Replace `telnet` calls with `ssh` or `sftp` in identified files.

---

### **Final Validation**  
- Confirm telnet is uninstalled (`which telnet` should return no path).  
- Test SSH connectivity to ensure no disruption in operations.

By following this playbook, you eliminate insecure telnet usage and enforce encrypted communication via SSH.
