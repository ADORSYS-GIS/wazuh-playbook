### Audit Tools Ownership Configuration Playbook

#### **Overview**  
This playbook addresses the ownership configuration of audit tools to ensure they are owned by the root user. Proper ownership prevents unauthorized access or manipulation of audit logs, which is critical for maintaining system integrity and security compliance.

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1. Assessment: Verify Current Ownership**
**Objective**: Confirm that audit tools are owned by the root user.

**Commands**:  
```bash
sudo stat -c "%n %U" /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace /sbin/auditd /sbin/augenrules
```

**Expected Output (Compliant)**:  
```
/sbin/auditctl root  
/sbin/aureport root  
/sbin/ausearch root  
/sbin/autrace root  
/sbin/auditd root  
/sbin/augenrules root
```

**Interpretation**:  
- If **all files show `root`** as the owner, the system is compliant.  
- If **any file does NOT show `root`**, proceed to remediation.

---

#### **2. Remediation: Change Ownership to Root**  
**Objective**: Set root as the owner of all audit tools.

**Command**:  
```bash
sudo chown root /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace /sbin/auditd /sbin/augenrules
```

**Notes**:  
- Use `sudo` to ensure you have administrative privileges.  
- Replace `root` with a specific privileged user if required by your environment (though this is not recommended).

---

#### **3. Post-Remediation Validation**  
Re-run the assessment command to confirm ownership changes:  
```bash
sudo stat -c "%n %U" /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace /sbin/auditd /sbin/augenrules
```

**Expected Output**:  
All files must now show `root` as the owner.

---

### **Example Scenarios**  

#### **Non-Compliant System Output**  
```
/sbin/auditctl daemon  
/sbin/aureport root  
/sbin/ausearch root  
/sbin/autrace root  
/sbin/auditd root  
/sbin/augenrules root
```  
**Action**: `/sbin/auditctl` is owned by `daemon` instead of `root` â€“ remediation required.

---

### **Troubleshooting**  
- **"No such file or directory"**: Ensure the `auditd` package is installed.  
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install auditd  # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo yum install audit       # RHEL/CentOS
  ```
- **Permission Denied**: Use `sudo` to execute commands with elevated privileges.

---

### **References**  
- **Rationale**: Unauthorized modification of audit tools can lead to tampering with audit logs, violating integrity (e.g., CIS Benchmark 4.1.3.1, NIST SP 800-53 AU-9).  
- **Relevant Standards**:  
  - CIS Controls v8: 8.2 (Audit Log Management)  
  - NIST SP 800-53: AU-9 (Protection of Audit Information)

---

**Summary**: Ensure audit tools are owned by root to protect against unauthorized access and maintain audit trail integrity.
