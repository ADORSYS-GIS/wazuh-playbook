### Step-by-Step Playbook: Remove iptables-persistent and Clean Dependencies  

#### **Objective**  
Ensure the `iptables-persistent` package is **not installed** to prevent conflicts, and clean up unused dependencies.  

---

### **Prerequisites**  
- **Access**: Root or sudo privileges.  
- **System**: Debian-based Linux (e.g., Ubuntu).  

---

### **Assessment & Remediation Steps**  

#### **1. Check if `iptables-persistent` is Installed**  
**Command**:  
```bash  
dpkg-query -s iptables-persistent  
```  
**Expected Result**:  
```bash  
Package 'iptables-persistent' is not installed  
```  

**If Installed**:  
```bash  
sudo apt purge iptables-persistent -y  
```  
**Follow-Up**:  
```bash  
sudo apt autoremove -y  
```  
**Purpose**:  
- `apt purge` removes the package and its configuration files.  
- `apt autoremove` cleans up unused dependencies.  

---

#### **2. Final Validation**  
Re-run the check to confirm removal:  
```bash  
dpkg-query -s iptables-persistent  
```  
**Expected Output**:  
```bash  
Package 'iptables-persistent' is not installed  
```  

---

### **Notes**  
- **Conflict Avoidance**: `iptables-persistent` may interfere with other firewall managers (e.g., `ufw`) by loading rules at boot.  
- **Backup (Optional)**: If rules were managed by `iptables-persistent`, back them up before removal:  
  ```bash  
  sudo cp /etc/iptables/rules.v{4,6} ~/backup/  
  ```  
- **Autoremove**: This step removes orphaned packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer needed.

This playbook ensures `iptables-persistent` is fully removed and dependencies are cleaned, minimizing potential conflicts.
